@RyLuras - Ryan Luras @sophiegraham - Sophie Graham

A lab from Alchemy Code Lab in which we create a bitmap transforming tool.
It will take a bitmap image and convert the pixel data according to various transformation functions; inverting the image, converting to grayscale etc.

To use: install dependencies with npm i, and run test checking with npm run start
